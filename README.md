### Operators and expressions

[Here](https://github.com/mdmosfikurrahman/JavaBasics/blob/main/src/main/java/org/epde/basic/operatorsExpressions/OperatorsAndExpressions.java), these topics were covered:

#### Operators:

1. _Arithmetic operators:_ + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus)
2. _Assignment operators:_ = (simple assignment), += (addition assignment), -= (subtraction assignment), *= (multiplication assignment), /= (division assignment), %= (modulus assignment)
3. _Comparison operators:_ == (equality), != (inequality), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to)
4. _Logical operators:_ && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT)
5. _Bitwise operators:_ & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise exclusive OR), ~ (bitwise complement), << (left shift), >> (right shift), >>> (unsigned right shift)

2. _Relational expressions:_ involve comparison operators and return a boolean value (true or false).
3. _Logical expressions:_ involve logical operators and return a boolean value (true or false).
4. _Bitwise expressions:_ involve bitwise operators and operate on individual bits of an integer value.
5. _Conditional expressions:_ involve the ternary operator (?) and return one of two values based on a condition.

### Control structures

[Here](https://github.com/mdmosfikurrahman/JavaBasics/blob/main/src/main/java/org/epde/basic/controlStructure/ControlStructure.java), these topics were covered:

1. **Conditional statements:** Conditional statements allow you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. The two main conditional statements in Java are the "if" statement and the "switch" statement.
   - The `if` statement allows you to check a single condition and execute a block of code if that condition is true. You can also use "else if" and "else" clauses to check additional conditions if the first condition is false.
   - The `switch` statement allows you to compare a variable or expression against multiple values and execute different blocks of code based on the matching value.
2. **Looping statements:** Looping statements allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. The three main looping statements in Java are the "for" loop, the "while" loop, and the "do-while" loop.
   - The `for` loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to execute the loop. It allows you to specify an initialization statement, a condition, and an iteration statement.
   - The `while` loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true. It only checks the condition at the beginning of each iteration.
   - The `do-while` loop is similar to the "while" loop, but it checks the condition at the end of each iteration. This means that the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.
3. **Branching statements:** Branching statements allow you to change the flow of your code based on certain conditions. The two main branching statements in Java are the "break" statement and the "continue" statement.
   - The `break` statement allows you to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely if a certain condition is met.
   - The `continue` statement allows you to skip to the next iteration of a loop if a certain condition is met.

### Arrays

[Here](https://github.com/mdmosfikurrahman/JavaBasics/tree/main/src/main/java/org/epde/basic/array/Array.java), these topics were covered:
1. **Declaring and initializing arrays:** Explain how to declare an array in Java, how to initialize an array with values, and how to access the elements of an array using index values. 
2. **Array operations:** Cover common array operations such as finding the length of an array, copying an array, sorting an array, and searching an array for a particular value. 
3. **Multidimensional arrays:** Explain how to declare and initialize multidimensional arrays in Java, such as 2D and 3D arrays, and how to access and modify their elements. 
4. **ArrayList:** Explain how to use the ArrayList class in Java to create dynamic arrays that can change in size during runtime, and how to add, remove, and access elements in an ArrayList. 
5. **Arrays vs ArrayList:** Explain the differences between arrays and ArrayLists, including their advantages and disadvantages, and when to use each one. 
6. **Enhanced for loop:** Introduce the enhanced for loop, which simplifies the process of iterating over an array or an ArrayList. 
7. **Arrays of objects:** Explain how to create an array of objects, how to access and modify the properties of the objects in the array, and how to sort an array of objects based on specific properties. 
8. **Arrays in algorithms:** Explain how arrays are used in common algorithms such as searching, sorting, and merging.

### Methods

[Here](https://github.com/mdmosfikurrahman/JavaBasics/blob/main/src/main/java/org/epde/basic/methods/Methods.java), these topics were covered:

4. **Method return types:** Cover the different types of method return values, including void methods, methods that return primitive types, and methods that return object types. 
5. **Access modifiers:** Explain the different access modifiers available in Java, including public, private, and protected, and how to use them to control method access. 
6. **Recursion:** Cover the basics of recursion in Java, including how to define recursive methods, and the pros and cons of using recursion. 
7. **Method design:** Explain good design practices for methods, including the use of descriptive method names, parameter naming conventions, and the principle of single responsibility. 
8. **Method libraries:** Cover some of the most commonly used methods in the Java standard library, such as the Math class methods and String class methods.

### Classes and objects

[Here](https://github.com/mdmosfikurrahman/JavaBasics/tree/main/src/main/java/org/epde/basic/classAndObjects), these topics were covered:

In Java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of properties (also known as instance variables) and methods that are shared by all objects created from that class. For example, if you were creating a class to represent a car, the class might include properties like make, model, and color, as well as methods like startEngine() and stopEngine(). 

To create an object in Java, you first need to define a class. Once you have a class defined, you can create objects (also known as instances) of that class. For example, you might create an object of the Car class by calling its constructor method, like this:
```java
Car myCar = new Car("Honda", "Civic", "blue");
```
This creates a new Car object with the make "Honda", the model "Civic", and the color "blue". You can then access the properties and methods of the object using the dot (.) operator. For example, you might call the `startEngine()` method on the myCar object like this:

```scss
myCar.startEngine();
```
This would call the `startEngine()` method defined in the Car class and execute its code.

In addition to defining properties and methods, a class can also include constructors, which are special methods used to create new objects of that class, and static methods, which belong to the class itself rather than to individual objects. You can also define access modifiers like public, private, and protected to control the visibility and accessibility of the class's properties and methods.

### Input and Output

[Here](https://github.com/mdmosfikurrahman/JavaBasics/blob/main/src/main/java/org/epde/basic/IO/InputOutput.java), these topics were covered:

1. **Reading user input:** To read input from the user, you can use the Scanner class in Java. Here's an example:
    ```java
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
    String name = scanner.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    ```
    In this example, we create a new Scanner object using `System.in` as the input source. Then we prompt the user to enter their name, read in their input using the `nextLine()` method, and store it in a String variable called name. Finally, we print a message using the user's name.

2. **Writing output:** To write output in Java, you can use the `System.out` object. Here's an example:
    ```java
    int x = 10;
    System.out.println("The value of x is: " + x);
    ```
    In this example, we create an integer variable called x and assign it the value 10. Then we use the `println()` method to print a message that includes the value of x.

3. **File input/output:** Java provides several classes for reading and writing data to files. For example, to read data from a file, you can use the FileReader class. Here's an example:
    ```java
    try {
        File file = new File("ReadFile.txt");
        FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
        int c;
        System.out.println("Contents of " + file.getName() + ":");
        while ((c = reader.read()) != -1) {
            System.out.print((char) c);
        }
        System.out.println();
        reader.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    ```
    In this example, we create a new FileReader object for the file `ReadFile.txt`. We then read data from the file using the `read()` method, which returns the next character in the file as an integer. We convert this integer to a character using a cast and print it to the console. When the end of the file is reached, `read()` returns -1 and the loop exits. Finally, we close the `FileReader` object.

4. **Creating File:** Writing data to a file is similar to reading data from a file, but we use the FileWriter class instead. Here's an example:
    ```java
        try {
            FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("NewFile.txt");
            writer.write("Hello, world!");
            writer.close();
            System.out.println("Data written to file successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    ```
    In this example, we create a new `FileWriter` object for the file `NewFile.txt`. We then use the `write()` method to write the string "Hello, world!" to the file. Finally, we close the `FileWriter` object.

### Variables and Data Types

[Here](https://github.com/mdmosfikurrahman/JavaBasics/blob/main/src/main/java/org/epde/basic/exceptionHandling/ExceptionHandling.java), these topics were covered:
1. **Try-catch blocks:** The try-catch block is used to catch exceptions that might occur during the execution of your code. The try block contains the code that might throw an exception, and the catch block is used to handle the exception if it is thrown.
2. **Exception types:** Java provides many different types of exceptions, such as ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, and IOException. You should cover the most common exception types and when they might occur.
3. **Throwing exceptions:** Sometimes you might want to throw an exception yourself if something unexpected happens in your code. You can do this using the throw statement.
4. **Finally blocks:** The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. This is useful for cleaning up resources, such as closing files or database connections.
5. **Catching multiple exceptions:** You can use multiple catch blocks to catch different types of exceptions that might occur in your code. This allows you to handle each exception type differently.
6. **Custom exceptions:** You can also create your own custom exceptions in Java. This is useful if you want to define your own exception types that are specific to your application.
