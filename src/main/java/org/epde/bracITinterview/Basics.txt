Difference between Spring and Spring Boot:

    Spring: Framework for building Java applications with comprehensive infrastructure support (like JDBC, JMS, etc.). Configuration can be extensive.
    Spring Boot: Built on top of Spring, it simplifies and accelerates application development. Auto-configures many dependencies and provides a production-ready setup out-of-the-box.

What is Dependency Injection (DI)?

    Dependency Injection: A design pattern in which components are given their dependencies rather than creating them internally. It helps achieve loose coupling, modularity, and easier unit testing by externalizing dependencies.

Authentication Flow Steps:

    Client Request with Credentials:
        The client sends a request to the server with authentication credentials. This could be username/password or other credentials.

    Authentication Filter:
        The request passes through an authentication filter or interceptor in the application. This filter intercepts requests to check for authentication credentials.

    Authentication Provider:
        The authentication provider (e.g., AuthenticationManager) validates the credentials provided by the client. Upon successful validation:
            A JWT (JSON Web Token) is generated.
            The token typically includes user information and expiration details.

    JWT Token Response:
        The server responds with the JWT token to the client.

    Store JWT (optional):
        The client may store the JWT token (e.g., in local storage or session storage) for subsequent requests. This step is optional depending on the application's architecture and security requirements.

    Authorized Request (with JWT):
        For subsequent requests requiring authentication, the client includes the JWT token in the request headers (usually in the Authorization header).

    Process Request:
        The server verifies the JWT token for each authorized request. It checks the token's validity, expiration, and any additional claims (like role-based access).

    Response:
        If the JWT is valid and authorized, the server processes the request and sends back the response with the requested data or performs the requested operation.

This flow diagram provides a high-level overview of how authentication with JWT works in a typical REST API setup. It's crucial for securing API endpoints and ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.
